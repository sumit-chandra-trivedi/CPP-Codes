// Additional Considerations:
// Automatic Management: If you're using smart pointers (like std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr), you donâ€™t need to worry about manual memory management, as they automatically handle resource cleanup. This can prevent issues related to memory leaks and dangling pointers.
// Rule of Three: If your class manages resources (like dynamic memory), you should implement the copy constructor, copy assignment operator, and destructor (the Rule of Three) to ensure proper resource management.
